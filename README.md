## General info
This script generates 2D and 3D contour plots of pslv and gslv mk-iii payload fairing.  
&nbsp;   
The main structural purpose of the payload fairing is to protect the payload from aerodynamic loading, heating, acoustic vibration,and other environmental conditions during the ascent phase.The payload fairing is no longer required once the vehicle clears the atmosphere.
This consists of four major sections:    

1.   Spherical nose cap   
2.   Conical section (PSLV) or Tangent Ogive section (GSLV)   
3.   Cylindrical section    
4.   Conical frustum, the boat tail section   

Configuration relative sizing and the spherically blunted tangent ogive estimations were acquired from the references given below.

## Setup
Script is written with python (Version: Python 3.8.5) on linux. Additional modules required :   

* numpy  (tested with Version: 1.19.4 )
* matplotlib (tested with Version:  3.3.3 )   


## How to run   
* Verify and install required modules 
* run `python payload_fairing.py`. 


## Updates   
* [12Mar2021]  
Updated code to plot payload fairings of both PSLV and GSLV MK-III in 2D & 3D   
* [26Jan2021]   
  Updated the code to reflect the changes in payload fairing from metallic structure to composite. Extracted information from the isro tender details as included in reference no.3
